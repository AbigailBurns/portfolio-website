<h2> 
Hello! My name is Abby Burns, and I am a junior Journalism major and Interactive Multimedia minor at The College of New Jersey.</h2>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio website, where all of my writing clips can be found. I write for TCNJ's chapter of Her Campus, an online magazine for college-aged 
women, and TCNJ's School of Engineering website. I also have writing samples from journalism classes, such as Magazine Writing and Writing for Interactive Media.
